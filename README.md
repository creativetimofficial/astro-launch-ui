## 🚀 Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```
/
├── CHANGELOG.MD
├── README.md
├── assets
│   ├── css
│   │   ├── input.css
│   │   └── material-tailwind.css
│   ├── js
│   │   └── astro-launch-ui.min.js
│   └── scss
│       └── loading-dot.css
├── astro.config.mjs
├── create-free-demo.js
├── hooks/
├── package.json
├── public/
├── src
│   ├── components/
│   ├── env.d.ts
│   ├── example.tsx
│   ├── header.tsx
│   ├── layouts
│   │   └── Layout.astro
│   ├── pages/
│   │   ├── 404.astro
│   │   ├── about.astro
│   │   ├── index.astro
│   │   ├── landing.astro
│   │   ├── login.astro
├── tailwind.config.js
└── tsconfig.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                | Action                                             |
